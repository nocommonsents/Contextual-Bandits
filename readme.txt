Run project with ./go.bat command (must be in exploChallenge folder)

3.5 GB Yahoo data set is on Google Drive.  Had to request access to file, so no use outside of academic purposes is allowed.

Goal is to create different simulated input files to compare performance of contextual bandit algorithms

Simulated input files will vary the number of users, number of features, probability of click, etc.

We will then test the same contextual bandit algorithms on the Yahoo data set to compare performance on real-world data

Contextual bandit policy is set in exploChallenge > Main.py in main method
